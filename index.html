<section class="introduction">
    <p>I've been conjuring up code since my teenage years.
        It was pure magic then, and honestly, it's still pure magic now that I get paid to write software.</p>

    <p>
        When I first encountered computers, they were still a rarity.
        The standard display was still that boxy CRT and IBM was still a thing in consumer hardware.
        Mice used to have a ball and later when the internet reached our homes, connecting required
        musical squeaks and whistles of a dial-up modem over a phone line.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated in 2014 with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and since then
        have been working as a Software Engineer in various tech stacks.
    </p>

    <p>I live in Bangalore with my family and our cat. When I step away from the keyboard,
        I'm usually off on a road trip, lost in a good non-fiction book or tending to my plants.

        projects to thoughts on life in general.</p>
